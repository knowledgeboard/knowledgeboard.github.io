It's the start of the blog, yaay!

How we doing? It's getting real, real fast. Miss some already, it might get
only worse, or not... we'll see.

### 2024-01-06 21:36
Everything is crazy, homesick at home yet I wanna leave so bad! Tomorrow big
time! (*added Spotify links, songs everywhere! Good job past me*)

### 2024-01-07 21:09
🇨🇭Successfully - landed, unpacked, called. So it begins. Started well with
trip from the airport (*glad for Eva*). Room needs small improvements (*bigger
ones wouldn't fit*). 

Gonna cut first night short hopefully. A lot to come tomorrow and I must be
able to talk without much thought. What's on my mind? 

1. How is everyone going to be.
2. How lost am I going to be.
3. I hope there is a gym nearby! Gonna search for one later.
4. What is the golf course like! :D

Glad for 🦆❤️ for staying with me at the airport! The best I could have wished
for!

### 2024-01-08 20:56

What a long day ha! 

8:15 morning meeting - the journey there was spooky because of bad routing, the
meeting was amazing, met a few poeple (Portuguese Peter, the IT data girl).

Meeting the team was bit quicker than I would like but got along well enough I
would say. I'm probably the youngest, with Amy the only other one who is not
physicist, alone in IT stuff. 

Lunch, back to back coffee breaks, Magda showing me around (gotta find her paper
again), A. showing me lab and our first rubber duck session on serial comms.
Looks like a pain of a problem with little to no debugging potential, hopefully
gonna be able to fiddle around a bit and get it working.

Probably gonna be making new website, should look into that (*some state of the art
html source*). And some simpler Python thingies.

### 2024-01-09 16:12

Hey there! Bunch of mails done today, M. is pouring info and there's still more
to go. Went to the 275 lab this morning, saw mountains for pretty much the
first time (*the view is much much better than what I expected*). Had small
debugging session with A., had zoom calls about bunch of guys speaking
french..., lunch and more debugging. 

A. gave me access to the **universe** amount of data (*like wtf is in 19PB of
experimental data and WHY THE FUCK is it in single folder somewhere AND WTF AM
I DOING WITH ACCESS TO IT IN CLOUD!!!* ... like, I'm not touching anything but
just saying). 

Did some search for the problem, helped to solve it finally after she was stuck
on it for weeks probs. God I hope I'm gonna be useful here (that felt nice)!
She's probably gonna let me fiddle around with much more from that one so I
should try to read up on electromagnets lul.

About hour more and home we go.

Also... got mail from M. that we are advised to go home and work remotely
because of the snow :D Interesting.

Also this is playing on repeat :D

### 2024-01-09 23:22

Well I wanted to go working out to Bushido Gym. Such a nice place and the guy
does only 1on1 sessions. Bummer. Gotta get on the bike thing tomorrow (not
literally yet). 

Looks like I'm gonna be learning javascript for web dev project. So even this
website might get a facelift who knows.

Well GN and let's try for a gym tomorrow after work!

### 2024-01-10 23:53

Good evening! Day pretty much successful. I am pretty active in helping A. with
the project. And she's having problems with such basic stuff (not meant bad,
she is not supposed to do better, she did great already with the amount that
she has written). But I feel like I could help more. Still feels good that I
can solve whatever she throws at me.

I was told that I might be able to participate during some of the ZULF
experiments if there is gonna be python shenanigans happening! That would mean
going to the Geneva hospital and doing something around their own small
accelerator!! Cool!

Started working on the website. Pain. Gonna continue tomorrow.

First time visiting the gym here! Gotta search for another one, because this
one costs a lot (25 CHF per visit/125 I think per month). Could do montly, but
would probably be better to look elsewhere too. Did chest, 100 bench 2x, 1x,
bunch of 90, 80. NOBODY KNOWS ANY ENGLISH, WTF!!! Was spotting the younger guy
who spoke only french. Like cmon learn some english as well, what are you
doing. Was happy with how it went tho.

Shower + Sleep! Cy@

### 2024-01-11 23:33

Day that went away quite quick! Work was great, I'm useful there and there are
more projects to come.

Spending time with A. on the project, I would like to help more but not forcing
anything. I mean it's still a project that funds everything that she does here.
So surely she wants to work on it by itself.

WTF that powerlifting belt. There were some visible hints but that's so cool!
Gonna have to try the CERN gym xD

P.S. Don't try the burger again! It's really not worth the money.

### 2024-01-12 22:50

First friday, first weekend incoming. The week went by super fast. Spent the
day struggling with the website kinda, but got a lot of progress in. I would
just hope to code it up all by myself. But first reactions were nice. Got the
*views* going at the end so it now seems like I know what I'm doing. Found out
that A. had the phd done in Oxford from what it looks like, just wow.

Have seen the french mountains clearly for the first time!

Great to talk to that Netherlands guys. Also Monika was one to talk to as well.
Probably gonna work with her more during the Vito web dev. Also stoked about
the next task (hopefully CERN approves it - learning JavaScript gonna be
interesting but not as hard I think).

I was the luckiest, late registering for the [BBC podcast
event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1330090/) and was able tob participate!
What a lucky thing, like 800 people with really well known faces in the front.
And most of the audience were CERN guys xD That's some audience as well (I
really gotta get my own trip to the LHC done, because that would be a shame not
actually seeing the big stuff). 

Adding some images from the podcast event and on my way home: (also the gallery
idea is not really bad - could use the slick library I found out about)

### 2024-01-13 23:14

First saturday, first walk through Geneva, first shopping madness at the end of
work day in coop. Geneva was cosy, not big, walkable. French is everywhere!
People actually don't know much english. I started doing french duolingo course
xD. Tried going to the Saint-Genis gym. Man they should really know a bit of
english everywhere... 

Geneva was nice, look at some of the nice images.

Sunday is about trying to find suitable gym. I already know about a boulder gym
and that is gonna be a plan for sometimes next week probably. We'll see what's
the program. Also I should look at those indico events, because there might be
something interesting that I'm missing.

### 2024-01-14 18:40

Soo no workout today, weird membership rules so a new member cannot go anywhere
just to try it once. Swiss people actually don't work on weekends.
But I was fortunate enough to have a **bouldering gym** pretty close in Geneva.
And that's gonna be a great place where to spend some time (even on Sundays!).
Light blues and one dark blue done today. Although I was getting embarassed by
climbing kids as always. Talked a bit to these two in CERN student girls and
they were great. One was getting seriously close to embarassing my climbing
too. But luckily I showed off well.

<img src="images/boulder.jpg" width=40%>

Not gonna work much more today. Will get a dinner in. And probably look at some
javascript thingy so I know what I'm getting myself into or I try to look for
some ways how to try and solve the ssh connection task.

Also I saw mountains on both sides for the first time! What a moment. The area
is much mountain-y than what I've expected.

### 2024-01-16 00:10

Hey there. Just one late entry before the bed. Had my first monday report
today. Felt like I was looking for words but it went ok. A. is giving me more
programming tasks. 

I became the master of cernoverride theme and hence the master of css. The site
is gonna look good! I never knew the strenght of nautilus mounting. 

Also went for the Bladonet nonstop gym and that's probably gonna be the gym to
stay in. My legs are so sore! 140 squats without belt for twos. Felt really
good. Place bit crowded but it never really stopped me from doing my stuff.

### 2024-01-16 15:55

This day takes so long, maybe because I'm basically alone here. Meeting is
coming up shortly. I've done some good work today, the DB is waiting for
approval, been running around asking questions and making stuff done. Will
finish the day with looking at c++ resources for A.

### 2024-01-16 23:21

OK so the meeting was really something. It was a safety meeting mainly because
of the fiery 24/10 incident with Ita. girl (the name of whom I'm still missing). 
It looked rough for everyone because of the safety procedure changes that have
to happen. It didn't sound that unreasonable, but I can imagine that those
clever minds can think of something just on the spot (*just as I do while
working*) that really has to be done in the moment and this kinda sabotages
their work.

Hopefully they get together to generate something that helps everyone and
doesn't threaten ISOLDE anymore.

Lidl shopping is goated. First chicken breasts today xD. Loved that. Would use
some more cutlery, but I managed.

### 2024-01-18 00:41

An interesting day. I was pretty useful, almost finishing the N. visualizer
project. Ending the day with actual python script generating real time data for
the DB and visualizer working as intended. Probably gonna implement it
tomorrow.

In next few days, I'm gonna talk to M. about the website so I'm a bit nervous
but I think we will manage together.

I really like how much I need to go around and communicate with others, because
I always feel like I know only half of the needed informations. And it's kinda
like a game, figuring out all the necessary pieces to put together. Real team
work feeling kinda. 

I opened my SWISS BANK ACCOUNT 🇨🇭 today! What a weird student's life this is.
This is like a whole adventure. I'm glad that I'm keeping up with this blog.

<img src="images/ubs.jpg" width=40%>

Finished my day with gym, chest day. I kept my strength mostly. Why are there
only 37.5kg dumbbells in the gym. I was already repping that. We'll have to do
some harder exercises with those ones. Other than that, I looked PEELED AF.

### 2024-01-18 13:08

Afterlunch one. Tasks flying, zoned out with the website, N. comes in with
Python requests. Still making improvements on website. Now gotta prepare the
final version of everything for visualizer. It's like a game. Need to *minmax*
all of it.

Started talking a lot with most of the guys at lunch. Feels like I'm slowly
getting tag of the *regular* one and kinda a part of team member.

### 2024-01-18 23:13

Evening entry. We have the test visualizer running :D My man is pumping it with
data 2 random doubles + time code + maybe something else every 200ms. We
already have some improvements for it and there are guys in the office looking
to get something of their own plotted as well. I might set them up for
something too.

Finally bought a cutting board, the living conditions are slowly but surely
improving. Also, found use for my first lessons level french in shape of *Cheval
steak* in Carrefour 🐴.

Also, this song might be a theme of this whole trip. It came out like a day or
two after my arrival and I'm completely hooked.

### 2024-01-19 23:45

End of the second working week. Clouds went finally away and it look awesome!
**TODO: add some pics!** Also tried to get the bike sorted but that went south
real bad. How does an atm not have enought money... 

The visualization app is running, although there is a problem on upload (not on
my side I think). And I had meeting with M. about the website and we finally
have some contents for it. She has some really ambitious ideas for it. I'll try
whats possible.

I'm going to look for some trips around the area. Gym tomorrow for sure!

I'm home from a first little trip of mine to Jura mountains. And I'm so glad
that I went. It was pretty cheap and quite easy to get to the mountains. Most
of the time I was choosing pretty nonsense tracks for myself. It was a weird
feeling being there just on my own. Felt kinda awkward for a bit. Gotta add
some of the pictures.

### 2024-01-22 10:56

No entry from yesterday, but mainly because I did almost nothing. Free day is
fine as well (probably). Listened to some IT stuff, I feel like doing some kind
of GPU raymarcher or voxel engine of some sort with physics and raycasting
(*yeah influenced by teardown for sure* - *imitation is the greatest form of
flattery*). 

Called with 🦆❤️ as always! I'm glad for her.

Also played around with this blog. Now know how I'm going to do img galeries,
it's now just a matter of choosing nice way of implementing it - struggled with
picture height/widht.

And I've started watching a bit of netflix in the evening! xD Started the *Full
swing* series about golf (drive-to-survive-like). And I was very impressed. So
I'm probably gonna look at that more.

NOW... It's Monday my dudes. Actually I'm really happy at work! Looks like some new
projects are slowly coming my way. We just had meeting with A. and M.
presenting their projects. A. measuring interfacial ionic conductivity in SSB
was like just beyond what I could have understand. But I think with couple of
searches I might get on top of that and it really sounded like a big great
thing. Actually a project where I can see a work on something tangible
(althought, nm of ssb xD). But it looks like some future tech which I would
have no clue about otherwise. Glad to be here with them.

Gotta go work on line fitting c++ before the lunch guy comes :D (muffin man:
the lunch man).

### 2024-01-23 00:23

Another Monday. What an eventful day! Got my credit card (made of cornstarch
for some reason). After last entry we almost immediately had lunch, I went to
work for a minute and Marius was heading away with Daniel to CMS for friendly
excursion. And stuffed happend and they had one free spot which he gave to me.
I'm so greateful. That was amazing. Gotta add some pics later **TODO: pics**.

Stuff like science fiction. 100m underground, built on top and with crane took
to the cavern. Crane was used to build the South African(I think) football
stadium roof in one piece. Detector was huge and we saw it move. On freaking
howercrafts xD ...scientists man (I'm kinda part of them). What a job to have.
Guys looked like regular technicians but must be so into what they are doing
and on another level. We also got to see mockup of the LHC tube which gave me a
better idea of what and how it actually works.

Got some work done in the end of the day. Ahhhh got my bike (#2277) this
morning! 100 CHF deposit well spent :D It looks sick! 

And did a evening (late evening) workout. It all feels great, but could be
better in there. Maybe in the next days.

See you tomorrow!

### 2024-01-23 23:43

Well today was more about programming than any other day xD I was deep in C++
the whole day. Trying to figure out how to compile those three libraries
together. Line fitting is gonna be in my dreams now. However, I think I figured
what I could do to make it work. Gonna be another day of cpp and that's fine!!!

Other than that I was fairly lazy. We watched another Black Mirror episode (I
think one of the worst episodes tbh). Bought some stuff for mornings, kikoman
for the rice and more pasta :P. Miss 🦆.

The bike is amazing tho. I almost came late for work because I just knew how
fast it's going to be.

### 2024-01-24 22:46

Quite a long day because I made it that way xD. Had a lot of fun with C++ in
the past two days. Have been working for A. on her line fitting and it just
couldn't compile together. So I tried to do my idea from yesterday and it
worked. Self-contained my ass, now it is truly self contained... Producing 3.5k
lines in 2 header and 1 cpp files. BUT it works without any need for some fancy
special compilation. Great! A. seems to like the outcome. Quick scripting
around and we were plotting different spectra left and right!. 

Quick cycle home and back for gym. Quite a strong back, but cannot shake that
idea that I lost size in the back. We'll see.

I was able to get a place at ATLAS guide for this friday and ALICE with Lisa
for early February! I'm probably gonna be able to see all the experiments I was
looking forward to!

### 2024-01-25 23:50

First half of the day great, second half meh. At least of the work part xD. 
Did some improvements for C++ and I loved the way it turned out. Everyone is on
safety procedures so I wasted some time with the website (*gotta add the content
first before making it look pretty!!*).

The weather is finally getting better! We get full days of at least partly blue
skies! So mountains are always visible and the bike rides are amazing.

Made some calls and did some bouldering afterwork. I moved up to a higher tier
(dark blue me)! Still there are so many better climbers that do it so easily xD
it's insane!

Friday next!

### 2024-01-27 19:24

No entry yesterday. Just because I was so tired in the evening I was happy to
persuade myself to go to bed. Friday was pretty sick (in a good way). Killer
leg workout, 160kg clean. Guys were crazy, but it's nice exploring new workout
routines.

Work was awesome. Pretty much all day spent with A. on C++ problems and
changes. And we again did fair amount of work which is always great! We talked
about gym as well and she might take me to see the CERN gym. We can surely talk
more gym later. We seem to get on well.

Also was to see the ATLAS experiment on Friday. Great presentation to actually
understand what happens inside of it. But in comparison with CMS a bit
underwhelming. CMS was just so cool that you could actually see inside of it.
BUT there was a rubber duck inside of the control room (*TODO:pics!*)
There we met with a few people around my age that also do technical
studentships and are mainly into IT. And I think I have pretty great position!
All the other guys seemed a bit fed up with their mundane tasks, which have no
clear results. It feels kind of special for everyone that I actually am in an
experiment group with experimental physicists.

TODAY (Saturday) was quite lazy for most of the day and then I went for a trip
to Migros in Thoiry. Didn't buy almost anything and spent there like an hour
just to go through everything while talking with mum :D That was great.

I did some accounting for the past 20 or so days that I have been here. And it
seems like that I'm gonna be fine with the money. I spent a bit more than what
would be usual for my normal month (I think) and I'm still well under the
budget 💵.

I searched for some golf courses and it seems like there are few really
affordable. I gotta get my clubs here and practice and play! That would be
amazing! Having like 10-15 rounds of golf during this trip?? JUST IMAGINE.

Finished my day with wraps and **Sisu** :D The most bloody movie I've seen in a
while in which the main character says like two sentences. That was something
else.

### 2024-01-28 18:12

Loundry is done! Hate it! Struggled to figure everything out as there is
nothing in english... But made it work and blacks are black and smelling good!

Gotta get dinner soon, wanna look at the CERN golf club when I now know a bit
more how everything works. Pretty excited about the golf courses that are
around so would be great to get the clubs here. And want to look at raymarching
in GPUs for possible raymarching project.

### 2024-01-30 00:15

Another Monday! The day went away so quick! I did almost nothing and still was
productive the whole time. Weird days! Went to visit the **N_TOF** facility
with other ISOLDE people. I'm not one of the nuclear physicists so it wasn't
aimed at me that much, BUT I think that I saw what F.Mraz was telling me about
(TimePix something device -- calibration of beam and laser?? or something like
that from what I talked to the head of N_TOF... which is also crazy). Lab with
the most RP precautions I have seen to this point. Also this AL^26 story xD
Kekw

We tried to work on magnet with A. but we got a leak. Before that we saw a
correct signal so that was positive!

End of the day was quick. With a few french phrases from me, M., I. and A. :D

Plus gym (filled but ok... headphones dead :/).

There's a farmers strike tomorrow from 9 in the morning. I'm interested if I'm
gonna see some of them xD

Life is good
See you tomorrow!

### 2024-01-30 19:21

Tuesday! I'm still waiting for the PIN for my card. Hopefully that comes soon.
Spending more and more time in the 275 :D. The C++ is always trying to argue
but I've always managed to persuade it somehow. For some reason A. thought that
I'm staying for only 3 months, so got something like (*cannot you stay for more
than 3 months* -> *oh you are staying for six :D*). I'm really glad to be
useful to others.

LHCB next. Met Fatimah and Enrico together with other guys from the visit. It
was quite a tiny detector compared to the other ones (but the lowest I've been
-- -108m). Detector for only one side of the collision and the huge
*rotor*-looking thingy on the other side. CMS still rules as the best I would
say.

Lazy rest of the evening.

### 2024-01-31 23:21
A long night with gym ... deadlifts -- 180 without a belt, 170x3 without a
belt, felt really strong just having to focus on streangtening my back as much
as possible so it does not move! Not the greatest thing for power but I'm
gaining confidence in those lower weights.

Pizza (tuna with red onions -- never seen in CZ) + chicken now :P.

The working days are going so fast now! Every day I'm at least once in the lab.
So there's c++ always on the menu. We are starting to make it work. Major
unexpected problem with the fitting as the data was nowhere close to being fit
correctly. The data is just to dense. Main peak is around -3500 which is so
much further. Worked at the end tho. Plus almost all the python is now
transfered!


### 2024-02-01 23:43

These days I'm more in the lab than anywhere else. C++ is always throwing rocks
at you but we are fighting well and it's moving! I was *interrogated* by M.
about the progress and at the end of the day we showed her some of it. It
wasn't perfect, but seemed alright! 

Also did some lighter leg workout... cos my legs are still burning from last
friday!

I'm looking forward to 🦆❤️! She's here in a minute! We called as pretty much
always and that's always nice to hear!

### 2024-02-04 01:49

Late saturday entry xD No entry from yesterday as I was expecting 🦆❤️ and had
no time afterwards to write anything. Was really awesome to meet again! More
left for the memories...

Today we were lazy, had lunch, walked through most of the CERN and R1 and
our offices, seen everything outside of the Meyrin site at CERN, went to
Manor for coffee and visited the best light festival ever (Geneva Lux --
possibly the 10th). It has been great having her around again! Made dinner and
watched Your Name. Lovely movie.

Such a long Saturday! Loved that. Bit of a shopping and climbing tomorrow :).

### 2024-02-05 08:43

Monday morning! Nothing from yesterday so here I am. It's not that it would
have been super busy or anything like that. It was just great having her around
and I didn't spend any time at pc. We stayed in mostly, went shopping for a
bit, had great lunch and went to the Totem bouldering gym, which went very
well.

Today she took me to my work and we left it off there. See you soon, hopefully!

### 2024-02-05 20:49

Another Monday!! Lab work continues, but the stabilisation was running today!
So big improvement. They always come at the end of the day to keep me there
longer than I would like (but I like it). I know all of the c++ project now so
the work is actually so good on it. And I have ideas how to improve fitting
with some smoothing things... Gonna be great.

🦆❤️ arrived home! The weekend was something that I really needed! We started
watching One Piece yesterday and it is surprisingly great. I should probably
give more on others opinions about these shows! They are actually fine.

Wanna look into c++ RayMarching for a bit! Tomorrow probably fast shop and gym.
See you then!

### 2024-02-07 00:07

Tuesday done. Work had not much programming, but I was a plumber, a solderer, a
cleaner and a technical mover when we were moving and securing the magnet again
(and I did a bit of programming :P). TODO: FINALLY ADD SOME PICS FROM THE
WEEKEND SIGNAL FESTIVAL AND FROM THE MOVING.

Went for a gym and missed 100kg bench and hit 5x90 afterwards... wtf. Not
great, not terrible... I think I might go for a creatine tomorrow. It might
have some play in that as well. 

Did a small shopping, mainly for meat. Got 2 packs, 1.6kg of chicken. Gonna
last three days at least on that xD.

And why am I writing so late??? I was cooking and met Armenian (I think) guys
(brothers... I think). And we spoke and spoke. Both learning english and french
at the same time. [Lufi] and [Abus] (31) are amazing! Drinking the whole time
but amazing xD 
- [Bon chance]
- [Bon courage]
- [a bianto] 
- [été] ... wtf is that language man ... summer
- [iver] (hiver) ... winter
- [moa] (mois) ... month
- [automne] ... autumn

My true first french lesson comes tomorrow.

### 2024-02-07 10:01

Finished all of my online lessons. Have to get safety stuff, dosimeter, and
full day RP/Electrical courses and we are done xD So much safety to do...

### 2024-02-07 23:12

First french lesson :D That's gonna be some fun. Guy speaks really a
french-english and french so it's like 50:50 foreign:foreign language lesson.
Which is awesome! Other than the obnoxious german guy, everything was amazing!

The work is slow now. There's not much to do on the magnet
because it does not work again. The water leaks fixes and subsequent
upgrades did not help much and actually made it worse for now. Hopefully it
gets better soon so we can see the stabilisation in action!

Gym felt good, back day, full of energy, good! 3 sets 90kg bentover rows. Felt
good.

Another long distance call and OnePiece!

Also my YoungLa stuff came this morning! Gonna get them tomorrow (*Clothing
show tomorrow? :P*).

### 2024-02-09 00:16

Hey I got my new gym gear! YoungLA is freaking goated. Everything fits
perfectly (*for my own liking*). And the double layered shorts! Goated.

Work was feeling slow today, but killed time with website (*filling up profile
pics with xkcd memes xD*). Preparing all of the content already. Probably gonna
spend tomorrow with it as well. Also, wanna get my dosimeter tomorrow morning.
ANd hopefully find some spot for earlier RP course than 2nd of April xD.

Ended the day with another OnePiece and some french.

And probably late gym tomorrow if I may guess. See you then! Bye.

### 2024-02-10 00:21

Long day but just a quick one. I was fortunate enough to land a spot on a trip
to Ostenensee (*maybe*) with a couple of other guys! BUT it's really ealry in
the morning... Sooo gotta hit bed asap. 

Work was weird! Magnet worked, then everything worked, then motor started doing
weird things... nwm, I thought I knew the solution... lunch and the spectrum is
nowhere to be found!!! Got my dosimeter today tho!

French... man who designed the numbering system. above 60 it's sum... above 80
it's partly multiplication WTF! Language sounds great tho and I love to add new
phrases to our convos with Lufi (*he's probably gonna be the king of the
pirates* xD).

I did a leg day today! With my new belt and shorts!!! Ohh I love those! 150kg
squat, 140x3 easily. Felt alright! Met this guy whose name I can't come up with
atm, super amazing english, great squats. 55 year old english teacher in
Geneva, absolute beast! Sporty, did squats with like 105/110, then went to
bench 3x5 100kg pretty much close grip bench like fuck yeah! Gotta talk to him
more! Also had a silent, distant moment with an gorg asian girl when we crossed
paths at CERN in the evening. Guys were going out and I was returning for my
bike. With the size of this thing, I'm probably not gonna see many guys more
than once xD Probably should talk to everyone interesting the first chance I
got.

See you tomorrow! Gotta wake up so early!

### 2024-02-11 18:46

Sunday, nothing yesterday as I was happy to be happy. Woke up super early to
meet 4 other guys at Carrefour and go to see on really really snowy adventure.
Nice hike although we could have gone a bit further (*batter safe than
sorry*). 

Today I took my window blinders fully down, so I slept till like 10:30 with no
problem xD did laundry, looked at french stuff, played arround with CUDA (*need
to find some sample projects for cuda opengl interopt*). Pretty nice calm day.

Played a bit of Shapez and got hooked on overoptimizing everything xD Not a
game for me probably... 
For some reason, I'm getting insecure feelings about stuff... but probably
that's just my weekend brain going over the allowed limit of thinking time...
I'm planning a small surprise for 🦆❤️.

### 2024-02-12 22:23

Monday! These always go away so fast xD Morning meeting with M. on zoom was fun
xD Bit of talk about github, lunch and solving problems with magnet. (*The
spectrum is shit... btw it's there*...). French was good but spent some more
time in lab while we were solving the magnet problem (Mik f-ed up probably and
ruined one of the pulse generators :D). Should be fixed and looked quite good
already!

Finally joined RP course (8 hours), and I'm doing electrical course tomorrow!
Gonna be interesting!

Hit gym, was really strong again! 100kg bench good, 37.5 for bunch of reps and
sets like nothing!

### 2024-02-13 22:13

Tusday was fine. The magnet is working again!! So the work begins...
unfortunately the serial connection on the arduino motor is shitty and there's
some work to be done with it. I'm probably sinking a few days into it.

Other than that I went shopping and had a lazy evening with a bit of reaserch
to cuda stuff and *Full Swing* videos. 

### 2024-02-15 00:20

Valentine's day! Everything arrived well :) Glad to make her happy with small
things like that! Was waiting till 4pm. the whole day... so the day went by
fast! We finished the live action One Piece xD Onto the anime now... xD

French was interesting and I feel like I'm slowly getting into it! I'm surely
not the best there. There are guys with latin knowledge and much better
pronunciation (I think with some french background too). But I'm getting the
words in! Trying to get some lessons every other day so I see it every day.

At work, arduino motor is killing me, I made some progress but it's the only
weird serial comm which doesn't want to behave. There are a few things to test
so I always have something to try! Other than that, we were able to run the
stabilisation so progress!

### 2024-02-15 23:13 

Back was really exhausted from last nights gym - deadlifts and more. So I'm
staying at home, cooking and being lazy. I found some interesting Cuda+OpenGL projects
so I might try to work with them.

I love how often I get to call with everyone! 🦆❤️ pretty much every day these
days!

Achievements at work! Stabilization ran for the first time for a long long
time. We are in area of just fixing corner cases, which break the comm once in
a while (haven't happened in a while). The arduino sucks, but we are handeling
it! Lovely encounter with Nik. yesterday when we got blame for him
disconnecting his own under current cables. It is a great fun with A. these
days! Had birthday yesterday so seemed under the weather xD It was a fun day!

### 2024-02-17 12:37

I'm up! xD Friday at work ended up with French lesson and Francesco offering me
and the indian girl their party that night! So I took Gin, got gym in between
and went there (in SG). 

The house was packed! It felt like a premium MFF party xD mainly guys, some
girls but at least everyone was quite talkative. Had fun. Talked to a few gym
guys xD The Estonian was really funny. We met with the US(Jeevi)/ITA friend
pair and other than the unreasonable tremblings for weed, they were great. It
was the ITA's girl first night at CERN, visiting her brother :D. Drank a little
but nothing crazy! Everyone was going arond 12-1, I went around 2 and was still
able to cycle home. Completely fine.

Gotta be a lazy day today, but still want to go climbing today!

### 2024-02-18 01:26

Lazy lazy saturday xD Bit of search for my next graphical app, shop, lunch, call
(we are thinking about timing on Dune 2), boulde, I did another dark blue and
new routes! And kinda injured my left ring finger a little on two hole pocket
and move to the right side. Immediate pain, was able to continue tho. Some
tendon shit probably. No big deal, can't push straight into it but again, you
can't otherwise even when it's fine xD. All good.

### 2024-02-19 00:20

Sunday was fun, finally did some stuff on the raymarching algorithm and it
looks goood on gpu! Did some meat prep, gym and looked at golf stuff. If I
don't receive an offer in next week I'm buying them on my own because that's
just horrible way of dealing with stuff and at the moment I REALLY don't care
about saving 2k to wait another X weeks.

Learning more french. Going great! fluent probably in no time xD

### 2024-02-19 23:26

Monday heeeey. It went by so fast again xD Maybe because of the 1.5h meeting
and 1.5h french lesson and 1h lunch xD. Had few trips to 275 with A. and a
little programming and git workflow was done. Currently working on new branch
to improve and clean up all of the things I can find. No way of testing which
makes it quite fun tho...

French went fine, although I was really exhausted for some reason and couldn't
concentrate much. Did time and it seemed alright (IF YOU KNOW NUMBERS WELL).
Spoke to the Indian girl and we might be able to get some bouldering session in
together (there is supposed to be a climbing gym in SG as well!! we'll see...).

Other than that we have planned (after a long thought) a weekend home visit
with Anička. Airplane prices are a bit steep but hey... you got the money, why
not hey.

ALSO the callaway XR 13 seems like a nice choice. I might get that one, if
there's a reasonable price on that.

### 2024-02-21 00:22

OK on friday I'm flying home! With 🦆❤️ as well! 

The day was full of programming, refactoring the stabilization code. We'll test
it tomorrow. Looking forward to that, because I feel like it must have changed
a lot, but I had no way of testing xD So programming in blind.

Gym-chest was alright... although bench is not as strong as I would like... did
90kg for 5,4.5,4.5.

We have watched first anime one piece! (One Pace actually) And it trully looked
like a pokemon xD Feels interesting.

### 2024-02-22 00:22

Hello, I HAVE FIRST CERN MERGE xD seems like nothing, it is nothing, BUT sounds
cool! My code works, it's faster, better, cleaner. Mornign was slow but after
lunch we made everything work and it felt great! 

A. played the **Barbara's bombastic Rhubarb pie**... and it's horrible... FUCK
IT, I'm gonna link it HERE xD

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7ki0Q2nYTBhVxZvqLLDp5W?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

French was quite fun. Ended with the german guy complaining about trafic. We had
great time with the indian girl just laughing at him. She finished him by *you
would die in India*. BASED TAKE xD

Gym after, legs. Why do I feel weak when I'm able to do (on the way up), do
everything, 4x140kg, 3x1x150kg, 2*9x120kg(till fail), (10-15)x100kg. STIL FEELS
WEAK WTF! finished with all other parts. Huge pump tho. It's probably fine!
Need some sleep now tho. See you later!

### 2024-02-22 23:55

Just finished a little fun talk with 🦆❤️! Love!

The day was quite long but maybe I'm already looking forward to tomorrow :)
Full day of rain so everyone stayed inside, no lab, just programming and
fooling around. 

No gym, but a quick shop and calm evening. See you at home!!

### 2024-02-24 12:15

HEY, I'm at home! Nothing from yesterday, the work day was quite nice, work on
my own NVIM Lua config, then did some work on CPP with A. No french lesson
unfortunately but was able to leave a bit earlier and catch my plane home.

Was able to get from work through airport security in less then 30 minutes xD
Absolutely amazing. Still had an hour to wait on the airport because of the
gate closing policy... kinda dumb. It would be great if it was possible to
close the gate like 10 mins before and that would make it much quicker for
some. Parents picked us up from the airport. Funny that the air travel was
exactly a half of the journey xD

Great to be at home. Had much fun with 🦆❤️!

### 2024-02-25 23:51

Heyo, I'm back at Geneva (Fr actually). The flight was awful xD but still
better than anything else! Like 2-2.5h delay because of plane's technical
probelms in Barcelona before Prague... Interesting. Although I was able to
spent a bit more time with 🦆❤️ and I've been really enjoying having her around!

I brought DUNE book with me. And immediately I was able to read a bunch of it
again while waiting for the plane and on the airplane. Other than that, the
trip from the airport was rather uneventful.

The weekend with everyone around was really amazing! Although I feel a bit bad
that I cannot properly talk about everything that is happening at CERN. While
I'm still really interested, I really am missing some stuff which are just
kinda out of my league... I'm gonna try to learn a bit and maybe I'm gonna be
able to talk about more interesting stuff on the next visit :).

### 2024-02-26 11:26

Got a low level Gamma MRI description from Mateus and that was lovely! Must
explore the website more!

The quartz tubes are filled with xenon and activated in reactor, shipped back,
tested for contaminations (of tubes), tested with gamma spectroscopy, then
crushed in vacuum to move to another tube to be then used in Gamma NMR for
improvements with polarised stuff...

### 2024-02-26 23:08

After gym - finally hit 100kg for 2 on bench again! ALSO I weighted in at 80kg.
Eating properly pays off looks like.

It was pretty strong. Probably the lazy weekend at home and sleep works well xD

### 2024-02-28 00:04

After One Pace post. We got another episode in and it's getting better and
better! 

Did pretty late gym today. Wanted to try 200kg deadlift... Legs weren't there
yet, probably still not 100% from last leg day (last thursday I think). 190
went hard. 170x3 good.

Work was fine, bit of setup work (TMUX and stuff), trying to get my VM started
to install QT creator for myself and some PICO5000 work - it sucks xD
Everything is an unexpected behaviour.

### 2024-02-28 15:53

Just talked to M. about different LHC stuff (my dumb little questions)... SOOO:

1. ISOLDE is one of the lowest energy points of the beam because we are
basically the closest to the origin (1.4 GeV),
2. BUT because of that we are getting like 50% of all the particles (as I was
told),
3. at the LHC things are bit more interesting (~14 TeV - 7 + 7),
4. the particles need time to saturate the LHC and get to the speed, they are
being fed in and accumulated and sped up AND then collision are set up to
happen,
5. soo *collision events* are happening for like a few hours - until they
decide it's not worth it anymore and saturation starts again,
6. also the *collision events* are pretty much probabilistic - meaning that
they are happening all the time (possibly at all places at once - *in LHC*)
BUT as it was described -- *hitting two particles together is like trying to
throw two needles across the Atlantic and hit them streight on*,
7. also cool! when it is not worth anymore - for some reason - particles are
dumped (*you guessed it*) into a beam dump xD M. said that one of the
towns/villages nearby is actually partly running their heating using the
heat from the particle dump (the only source we found atm is about the water
being used --
[link](https://home.cern/news/news/engineering/lhcs-cooling-system-energy-source-cerns-neighbours)).

### 2024-02-28 23:40

Well, today was a good day, calm evening with shop and then dinner and nothing.
Stayed a bit late at work, just talking with M., I. and D. about everything
funny beamtime. 

I missed the french lesson today... I was so caught up in the work (was doing
bunch of great pointer magic and I managed to make it work! *VOID Pointers suck
it!!*). So unfortnuately but hey, don't let it stink that long. Tomorrow there
is some emergency Python coding because A. and M. were in the hospital and
Python is throwing some errors! Let's GO!

Have been talking with M about LHC (see up for more ^^^).

Golf clubs called! They are on the way! XR13 stiff here we gooo!

### 2024-02-29 23:51

The Grand Budapest Hotel is amazing! Thank you M.

The day was lazy... I sunk it into the PICO5000 problem. In the end when I
started to rewrite init, because I stopped trusting A's setup and she sat with
me. We found the issue like in the second or third function.... Well I'm glad
it works now.
On more possitive note. It looks like I'm gonna be joining them in the Genevian
hospital tomorrow to debug python on site! What a fortunate position that I am
working at!

Gym was harsh. Bit of legs, tried squats -- did couple sets of 140, but sore
back from last strength backday didn't allow for much. The other parts were
fine and walking lunges as well. Might try to incorporate them more into my
trainings. 

Also A. invited me to ski with them on saturday! Time to scavange for
approriate tools xD

🦆❤️ arrrived to Budapest today. Hope they are gonna be alright. She's the best
I could have wished for. For some reason I'm not feeling 100%. I hope it all
goes fine during the semester and that we can keep our long distance thing
running well.

### 2024-03-01 22:49

Well what do you know, I was in the hospital today and I was somehow useful. A.
gave me a short description of what we were actually doing. From what I got --
we are trying to do some kind of chemical polarisation (why is there hydrogen,
amonia, other stuff, dunno yet). But the substance get's activated, somehow
polarised and we test that polarisation on two detectors (counters).
I have some pics from the lab (TODO: pics) and I felt like an astronaut in foreign lands. It
was great! What an IT position.

I managed to make it back to french in time. I actually dind't lose much last
time because we have done body parts again. 

Afterwards we talked with N. for a moment and I went to Decathlon in Geneva to
buy some ski equipment. BECAUSE I'M GONNA GO SKI TOMORROW! HELL YEAH!

### 2024-03-03 23:47

Sunday, nothing from yesterday as there was a full day of skiing and had no
energy to do nothing else after that xD But it was awesome! We have really
really great ability on skies. Timo has been said to be the best and I was way
more in my own element around there. It was really awesome, had a great time.
The snow quality wasn't the best, it was around +5-7 degrees all day so it was
getting heavier, but I got a better set of skies (rent - Noir set/Black set).
And I was fairly happy about my choice. (TODO: ADD ALL THE SNOW PICS)

Today I slept a lot xD but my legs were quite fine. I got a late lunch, decided
to go for the Car Show. The main part was a little underwhelming, but the
supercar section and older cars were amazing (TODO: again, pictures).

Got more hypertrophy chest workout in after that -- so I made it into a fully
active weekend xD. Was really happy with that as well.

Nadin is talking with me again. I'm probably gonna help her with some IT
knowledge towards her new job now.

### 2024-03-04 22:53

Monday and a fast day again. Long meeting with A. missing so b275 was directed
to me xDD Actually had something to talk about. Other than that, flatbuffers
started working so P5000 is getting data. Which is positive! And M. sent me
first info about my next project -- UI for the magnet. That's gonna be a lot of
reaserch from what it looks like now.

I had the last french lesson today which was good. It's weird that they named
lune after croissant xD And we talked with Nyai and that was fun.

I found the equipment for what I need for golf! Gotta be a small shopping
spree.

Back day, and that was alright. My back has mostly recovered from last
wednesday or when that was. Felt actually pretty strong but the gym was packed
and everyone was doing cables...

Also, the washing machines tried to fuck me over but I managed to get it done.
Well, no washing but at least I got my money back... Gotta try again tomorrow.

### 2024-03-05 23:34

Tuesday and the work was fun. Almost full day spent with A. on software for
counters (hospital stuff). AND WE made it work at like 17:45.

On worse note I might have shingles. As if it wasn't destined to be -- some
problem on my half year stay here. We are gonna get through. 

I have my plane tickets for Easter and looking forward to everything and Finja
afterwards. Gotta get some hikes planed.

### 2024-03-06 15:52

FIRST Actuall case of testing from which floor the egg breaks. AMAZING!

Also I'm making our Italian friend into a cpp developer. Que the Silicon Valley
"her java subroutine is so sexy" moment xDDD. 

<img src="images/java.jpg" alt="java" width=40%>

Also went through morning check at CERN and an afternoon check at the Meyrin
hospital. I would say everything alright. It's not, doctor confirmed shingles
for now and I have meds. That's the good part.

Back to work.

### 2024-03-07 00:07

Home, not doing much, but at least I know what's up with me and we can do
something with it. Early night and RP course tomorrow.

### 2024-03-07 21:30

I am fully protected AAAND 🦆❤️ is here!

Well I'm fully protected! RP was fun. Went there with one Italian girl and like
6 firefighters. Pretty easy, advanced physics helped the radiation knowledge.

M. was bothering me a bit because the stabilisation software was not working.
A. probably wrote the procedure a bit worse than it should have been for M. BUT
it was working when I made it there... yes I was picked up and driven to 275
instead of lunch and got to debugging. The program ran BUT the fitting was
acting up again... as the signal of 23Na is like 16 times lower than what it
was before. So that's gonna be fun.

Love here.

### 2024-03-08 23:10

Well that was a long friday, work since the earliest morning. Today I worked in
2 programming languages, spoke about 4, worked on 4 different
projects/codebases. So fun everywhere all the time. AND everything was
successful for some reason xD
I almost fucked up tho... Almost got rid of all the changes that Mark made to
the pico script (somehow).

Then I had a company to come home from work with. And that was great change
from normality.

Shop, cooking and movie. Nice evening.

The rash is really going away. Love that. Gym next week again.

### 2024-03-10 23:43

Sunday, had no mind on writting any entries when A. was here with me. We saw
Dune 2 on saturday and that was epic. Thinking about rewatching it!

Weekend was great, although lazy xD Looking forward to more!

### 2024-03-11 10:45

Monday, ran away from the meeting to have a check in with the doctors. Blood
tests fine. All well. Low testosteron probably, need to add some FOR SURE fr
fr bro trust me!

### 2024-03-11 22:51

What a monday! Always feels great. After my blood results I came back to the
meeting and immediately was mentioned as needed at few different places! Mich.
said he booked me for the week and after lunch I. was like that she needs me
for moment as well xD Love to be useful around here.

Went to 275 after lunch with Mich. We talked about the LHC and that was
amazing! 

- we talked about the syncronization of everything in LHC
- synced batches with 25ns gaps (I think) from the series of lower boosters and
accelerators
- 8T magnets steering everything around (15-20 mins run-up time)
- about a 10% of the sinlge group energy to clench a magnet
- LEP - electron-positron collider - some energy getting thrown out when a
charged particle is turning at high speeds (e^- losing about 10% energy a
turn!)
- LHC - run up about 2 hours - longest stay about 2 days (1 days avg)
- the 900m abort gap - wtf - 3 microsecond gap with a synced power source which
can come up in power in that time to charge a H-beam (type of thing) to
induce *small* magnetic field to steer the particles away to dump
- [facts and figures](https://home.cern/resources/faqs/facts-and-figures-about-lhc#:~:text=The%20Large%20Hadron%20Collider%20(LHC,Swiss%20border%20near%20Geneva%2C%20Switzerland.)
- [LHC wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider)

WHAT A WORLD TO WORK IN!

Other then that I was able to help with the program for the counters for
hospital fairly quickly. And was able to improve it, fix it up and speed it up.
More work on it later in the week probably. There's bunch of redundant work
that can be gotten rid of. Absolutely looking forward to tomorrow (with no
exact plan... just love to go there!).

### 2024-03-12 22:58

Tuesday, fairly long, didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. So came
into work completely gone with no energy!

Well, I. came :D And we sat down multiple times. Finally made her a proper
developer experience with VSCode. She was doing CPP hardcore way in GEdit only!
Brave one! She was so happy about the change xD 

Would love to go to the gym, but I already told myself that I have to wait! At
least till tomorrow and then we'll see! It all looks good.

Have seen first part of the Avatar yesterday. IT FUCKING SUCKED! It all felt so
overdone and just fake!

### 2024-03-13 14:00

Hey guys came back from the hospital and codes for both counters worked
basically perfectly for few hours with no delays and M. was really happy with
how well it worked! Great one there!

### 2024-03-14 00:43

Dune 2 again, the only reason to come so late when you have to work the next
day. I might be a bit psychotic, because I was hoping for all the bad things to
happen to the guy sitting next to me! He was complete dickhead! Just talking to
the one sitting next to him and just f****** overreacting to something that is
known to happen! Like wtf. Nevertheless, enjoyed the rewatch. 

My shoulder is almost healed... so I'm thinking about gym tomorrow! We'll see
at what time I get home.

Let's hit bed now!

### 2024-03-14 22:48

Finally went to the gym again! Chest day, incline didn't feel that great, but
still did 80kg and was doing 8s of 70kg for sets. 35kg/hand on flat bench felt
good for bunch of reps, flies, flies, presses, cables. Great pump when taking
off the jumper! MORE TO COME!

Work is pretty filled nowadays. Working on the pico2000 still. Helping I. as
she deleted 3 days of work but we got it back xD No crying yet! And we have
talked the magnet project over with M. and now I have an idea what is there to
do.

GOLF accessories came home! Looking forward to that A LOT!

And also... I was working a bit on my "Dunes" app, which is currently a height
map terrain renderer but still cool xD completely different kind of shaders
than what I have done before! (TODO: add pics of )

### 2024-03-15 09:03

You come to work and immediately you get new (luckily really small) assignments
from Mag. and a laugh from Mar. xD as expected! 

### 2024-03-16 00:17

Well I worked on a lot today! Mag. got her project even before lunch. Did some
more pico2000 work and am still helping A. and I. with their work. I'm really
glad to be this useful! There was a funny moment between me, A. and I. about
the few deleted days of work and "OMG I. how have you gotten so far with
GEdit" moment. Impressive indeed!

AAAND FOR SOME REASON, I'm chairing the monday meeting! That's gonna be fun!
Like wtf what am I supposed to do :D Email sent so hopefully we are gonna make
it through it in one piece.

Gym session again! Back focused, cables, Štěpán-styled and it was juicy. Came
home after midnight xD So great! My happy meal got soked...

He says that he might have injured his back again... I hope he's alright tho so
we can try some together here!

### 2024-03-16 23:02

Saturday! Lazy morning but I went out to Geneva in the afternoon. First to the
Rituals shop for Čaky. And I think that I spent less than a minute in there.
Around 90CHF lighter I came out with all what she wanted! xD So trip well
spent. 

Then I ran into a huge Palestine demonstration (I was wondering why there were
so many people) xD

Did a fine leg day afterwards and I'm enjoying every minute of it Jerry xDD

We are talking/calling with 🦆❤️ a lot lately and I just love it. I'm glad we
learned how to communicate in this way as well!

### 2024-03-17 23:00

Lazy lazy day. The laundry is still working only partly. I did bunch of work on
my 3D env again. Now looks really really cool!

<img src="images/env1.jpg" width=40%>
<img src="images/env2.jpg" width=40%>

And some one pace again. 

Found out that the people at Schuman's have rotated and now I'm surrounded by
Asian people (some Chinese from what I know). Actually met 4 in the evening
while making dinner.

### 2024-03-18 11:22

Today I led my first Monday morning meeting and crushed it xD. It was alright!
Immediately I was not sure how to write the first word into the sheet but I got
it right xDD Morning exercise. But it was fun. And also there are more and more
tasks being put onto me. I'm useful! Gotta deliver.

Wanna ask A. for a workout sometime this/next week. And gotta put my vacation
in.

### 2024-03-19 02:23

Work day was alright. Finished my Pico2000 button with more weird c++ quirks.
Starting to config env for Mich. stuff.

Good chest today with YoungLA top, bunch of new guys talking to me because of
my asian friend! 

Came home around 11. The other building washing machine was free so I ran into
it and luckily was able to get my washing done. Took shower, went to switch to
drier, did my dinner, came to the drier and that bitch was not on, stuck on
different mode than what I have selected and still on 40min timer. Took out the
stuff, let it run out, and go to our building to put it into the working drier
there. 20 mins later struggling to start it up because of no signal on that
drier like fuck me. Went back to the other building, waited for like 10 more
minutes to start 40 minute drying again! Well I'm dead.

### 2024-03-19 13:44

BTW I'm dead from the morning.

So almost just went to the hospital. Amy was able to resolve the issue on her
own. Again a reason for M. to drive to pick me up from office xD

### 2024-03-20 00:53

Long day, with eventful lunch when I started getting messages about problems at
hospital and that I might need to go there IMMEDIATELY!

Other than that I had fun setting up the project for Mich. It was actually
really easy to start new QT with Cmake and making the compile commands done and
voila I have QT project with linting and intelisens in nvim on my pc (github
magic).

After rough night yesterday I decided to rest instead of gym. So lazy evening.
Gonna look through the map for hikes tomorrow and possibly arm gym.

### 2024-03-20 23:56

Hey! Soo pretty good day. Work was nice, pretty calm, most of the guys were in
the hospital. Nik. with Dan were doing their sculpture all day. I did some Pico
refactoring and then started working a bit more on UI design for Mich. Which
turned out pretty well. There is still no functionality and a few ABORT buttons
missing, but we are getting there..

At the end of the day, we had a bit of fun with Mich. talking about him
choosing summer students and reading about everyone who doesn't satisfy what he
needs. AAAND how lucky we were to even get there (as he said that he was the
only guy satisfying Mag. criteria when she was looking for someone).

And then guys just got up and were like, let's get beers. Well not saying that
it suited me and I had a small headache, probably just dehydrated after gym but
was a social event xD.

Took a trip to see barber, trying to go there tomorrow. And then gym. Back!
100kg bentover rows fairly well done. I was happy. Did some other small new
exercises just to feel them around. And it was quite good.

Also talked with Jirka for a moment. He's in Kbely airport and like wtf we were
both talking from such a weird places. Need to get back to him at some point.
Miss my bro!

ALSO also... Finja is slowly backing away from the trip... which really bumming
me out... But at the worst. I'm going to travel on my own! DON'T LET THE
FEELING OF BEING ALONE STOP YOU FROM ENJOYING ALL OF THIS! Live a little. Even
without side. (I'll try to get someone else here... but alone would work for me
too).

### 2024-03-22 00:42

NEW haircut! And love it again! Was necessary because it was already getting
out of hand. Went on to do some arms, first arm day in a while and it was
really good! Tried after the trentwins lee priest arm workout. Took some
inspiration from that and was really interesting. Not for everyday but good.

Spoke with Finja for a bit and we are probably gonna make it for the week after
Easter. We'll see!
Also called with 🦆❤️ and that was fun (from morning fun all the way until
evening).

Work was also fine! Working on UI for the magnet source.

### 2024-03-23 00:26

Friday! Pretty calm working day all the time looking forward to evening gym.
Legs with the boys! 
And enjoy it I did. We took some mexican drugs, there were 4 of us in the end
and on top of that I spoke with Miguel, my new Brazilian workout friend, who
I met there and in CERN multiple times already.

Legs were fine. Hit 150 fairly easy and 160 with small help (I'm going so low
with my squats it's crazy). My form holds up well.
Then we did deadlifts for some reason and I'm the strongest with the best form!
WTF. Some killer 200kg legpresses and extension and we (I) were done.

### 2024-03-24 23:48

Sunday, not much being done, but I have created trails (some nice places to
visit). All of them scattered in a similar areas so that's gonna be nice. Also
we got an idea with Ann. to take a tent and sleep somewhere on/off trail! Would
be amazing to find some spot for that (have some in mind ... hehe Instagram)! 

Also played around with my gpu project. I now have tesselation working really
well! It wasn't even that hard, so that is amazing, there are some nice videos
which I have already sent to Degu! Really looks great!

### 2024-03-26 01:10

Just finishing my laundry. Late monday entry!

Work went fast, spent some time on UI improvements and first serial writes
(with no machine on the other side BTW)... And then did some work with A. on
Picos (we took a look at it, made it work again and stuff like that).

Hit gym afterwards, met Miguel again! And also met (not spoke to tho) the other
huge CERN bearded guy. Was repping like 100-110kg benches like crazy. Huge.

Ann. might be getting sick... I hope we get to be together for a bit at least. 

I had a look at rental cars and all those options felt surprisingly cheap to
me... Hopefully the price ranges don't lie. I might actually just rent a car
for a day or two for me and Ann. and we might be able to do some nice trips
that way!

Also I'm getting a little anxious about the golf clubs. I hope that's gonna be
alright and they are gonna be just waiting for me to get them!

Gotta get my laundry now! Cya.

### 2024-03-27 09:33

Late Tuesday entry on Wednesday. Yesterday was calm, didn't do much after work,
just small shop and met Niya around there for a bit. There was absolutely huge
overcrowding happening in the kitchen with like 7 people being there. New
french girl which Abus took under his ... wings (smoked weed for starters - at
least smelled better than the usual cigarettes). And I'm ready for home :)

Work was alright, did a stroll through the lab and worked on more UI for the
app. I've pretty much mapped out all the functionality we might want to test
before automated runs, so that's going to be good. 

And A. came to talk about work. She was trying to postpone the work with the
pico5000 data because she didn't want to work on the file processing. She
seemed fairly better after knowing that I did all of it and that there is just
a single calculating func for her to change! Happy to help!

Now at work, attestation of work ready, everything prepared for my leave.
Around lunch time, I'm going!

### 2024-03-29 17:09

Friday! Quick recap... flight went just fine. Met with 🦆❤️ and we had a lovely
couple of days together. Now I'm on train back home, for Saturday and Sunday
and then back to Geneva. 

First time we were able to spent a few days at Ann's dorms! Lazy cos she's ill
a bit but we started watching `3 body problem` aaand it's great! We are almost
done. ToBeFinished this weekend :D!

### 2024-03-31 17:23

OMW from HK to PRAGUE, gonna arrive around 18:40, some time to get to the
airport and then 21:15 flight to Geneva. Today with the new travel bag
half-filled with not exactly just golf stuff, so hopefully we are gonna be
alright!

Stay home was nice a for minute. Again got a lecture about what feels like my
*unhealthy* body, which always pains me. Last time I came home heavier and they
thought I was smaller. Dunno what that's all about. I'm gonna do what I enjoy
and like (keep moving as much as I can!). Plug golf is gonna add to that in
just a few days I hope!!

Other than that I was happy to meet Degu when I arrived to Prague and to have
Ann. again with me!

BTW. The 3D project looks sick!

### 2024-04-01 02:44

Well what an eventful journey. An hour+ delay for the flight, got all my
baggage, had 15 mins to get to the last tram to CERN and walk from there.
Luckily made it all work (otherwise I would be sleeping in the gym or something
like that). Came soaked but happy to be here. Pizza, shower and done.

### 2024-04-02 00:56

Really bad head day... I'm probably just tired and didn't get to go gym because
I felt not great after yesterdays journey after midnight. 

We finished `3 body problem` tho and that was nice!

### 2024-04-02 23:23

Who would have guessed that resting for a few days can help! 105kg benches
alone went smoothly! Felt like a beast!

Work was great. Slowly future proofing the program for Mich. which is going
well! Hopefully I get to test it in a couple of days, after F. leaves. 
Literally noone was at work, lunch was only me and A.

ALSO, F. is arriving tomorrow! Car rental prepared. Gotta choose the best day
for our long trip, but the weather looks fairly nice these days so hopefully it
holds up!

### 2024-04-03 09:32

F. is on the train already! Car pickup is tomorrow at 18:00.

### 2024-04-03 22:21

Package arrived, well fed, looks satisfied. Car pickup tomorrow!

...

I'm not sleeping, pumped from the gym today, a loong session with tries on
200kg deadlifts and then bunch of talk with Miguel. I'm gonna try to be with
him as long as possible before he leaves. 

We shared a lot. And he had fair bit of inputs, really productive ones,
although I'm afraid of what he sees in the problems. He's probably mostly right
in what he talks about (really smart). 

We have gone for McDonald's after, geeking about our past projects, talking
boys talk, stuff like that. Told me about his past fling with the gym girl and
we had bunch of fun about that(everything in general). Also told me about his
amazing maze project done in CPU architecture with bunch of weird problems. We
really do share this kind of love for coming up with our problems to solve.
Drove me home from CERN as well. More talk. 

Back to work after a few days of vacation. No entries, as I rarely had any time
in our days and PC was mostly a radio. I'll probably add the pictures and
that's gonna be enough for the memories TODO. I managed to drive us around
safely all the way. The Interlaken trip was really really great but it
surprised me how taxing it must have been on the body. Think like 500km in the
day there and back. And was feeling fairly well when arriving. But then it
really just hit all and I was like completely down from that. Got better in the
morning. Also talked with Ann. that evening. Was and will be a bit of a
struggle, but I should believe in that. 

Work work was great today, beamline preps continuing, actually some pumping
tests were done. I'm done preparing bot for monitoring. Gonna do grafana alerts
next.

### 2024-04-09 13:01

I really hate the look on Monika's face. There seems to be some problems around
some electrical part at the beamline. They all care greatly about their work. I
cannot imagine that they don't look forward to working, even though it must be
always fair bit of stress.

My Italian friend picked me up randomly at the bus station in the morning.
'Italian taxi xD'. She told me they are already spending overtimes at the hall!
But only see it as *it is what it is*.
She seems to like me, I'm happy to help!

### 2024-04-10 02:00

Well that was an active day! Work focused on more chat bots, alerting at all
levels now! Small prep with Ila. tomorrow.

Went bouldering afterwards was doing dark blue ones and it was doing amazing!
Did like all the routes I went for! Niya joined me for a bit with couple of
friends. And it really seems like I'm climbing pretty well!
Aaaan I went to the gym afterwards, which was not the best idea in hindsight.
Did more chest with Miguel. Lost all my energy after first few exercises and
was just struggling through it. Talking with him is always great tho!

Also received an email from Mag. about origin position. Dunno what's that
suggestion, but might remember it later!

### 2024-04-10 23:58

Calm work day with not much to do in the afternoon, worked on the chatbots,
did some limit setting with Ila. and system works. Great to see. Afternoon
spent with my own research and a bit more testing of the systems. 

Also! I have access to ISOLDEHALL now! I'm really looking forward to seeing
that!

Masters at Augusta (Georgia) starting tomorrow! Gonna try and watch that on the
live feeds! (new info, starting on 14:00 my time, and tiger around 7pm).

Went for legday today, back still sore from Monday but getting better. Did some
bodybuilding type of legday, with heavy slow legpresses. Felt good but tired!

(weird highlight - chocolate musli)

### 2024-04-14 00:20

Saturday! Been a few days without this. What happened? Mainly was watching
*Masters* since thursday! xD

Everything works at work. Guys are doing hela overtimes, so we've been talking
a lot about it with Ila. Also A. always comes to me during lunch and seems
really talkative with me always. Always happy about that!

Really looking forward to golf clubs! Can't wait to start playing as well!
Well, just Masters at this point!

Gym has been going really well! Did legs on Wednesday, rest proper chest again
on Friday with an amazing pump, have really round chest at the moment. And
again at 80kg again!
Did late back today, partly with Dimo (asian friend) with some posing
afterwards.

Also we had a play session with 🦆❤️ again! So I'm really looking forward to
having her around again. Possibly with new additions as well.

Now a meal and then creating the post for IG with Finja's pics.

### 2024-04-15 01:00

Sunday done, Scottie Scheffler is Masters champion and I want to play golf! xD

Lazy sunday, nice curry lunch tho.

### 2024-04-16 00:30 

Monday eeey. Done with food and work and everything! Shower and I'm going!

We went to ISOLDE top room for the morning meeting. I'm always getting small
credits for work on the systems which non of them can see but they work!

Did gym then. Chest day, 3x5x90kg fairly nice! And was getting some eyes from
two girls there.

Also Finja told me about a concert (festival) happening. I think she might be
coming back for that xD Would be funny!
Gotta look for the tickets tomorrow!

Also have more fun pics of Mark (gotta add some of them here!) TODO:

### 2024-04-17 17:32

Wednesday, nothing from yesterday as I was fairly lazy in the evening. Doing
laundry and watching *Hot shots* with Ann. xD amazing movie.

Today I found out why the nmrdq is losing connection sometimes. Filling up the
TCP ports. How was noone annoyed with it? Just restart it and it's ok... well
it's up to me now. I might change how the bot works to make it safer. Just pool
a txt source file and let it stay on one connection all the time.

Going to gym after work. And 🦆❤️ is coming tomorrow!

### 2024-04-17 23:30

Gym was fun, back day. Seems like everyone is watching me! Even the *not the
nicest* girl group... Full workout went well and then Miguel came and we spent
another hour just talking xD Soo I came home late again.

### 2024-04-19 00:00

Ann is here again! Work is getting more interesting as the issues start to get
more serious, closer we get to the beamtime. Planning the trip with Miguel!
My timing bot is working really well! Putting it up tomorrow.

Also doing bodyguard stuff tomorrow morning! Gotta be funny!

### 2024-04-22 22:20

Monday, bit under the weather from yesterday so literally took a day off (after
work xD), watched some movies, ate properly, all that fun. Beamtime prep in
full force! It's really funny seeing everything happening! Also have a couple
nice pics from all of it.

### 2024-04-24 00:46

First beamtime started. First shifts started (probs not for me, but I'm still
going to be part of all the fun). Most of the day at ISOLDE, finishing an hour
later than I should but it was really interesting till the end! Like 11 people
in the "controll room" at ISOLDE. Booster had circuit breaker troubles, our DAQ
has all the troubles. More sorting out to be done tomorrow!

Gym done again! Still some caugh but I'm feeling better after the rest
yesterday! SOO WELL THAT I DID LEGS. And I don't feel so good anymore xDD JK,
did pretty well, it was just hard as always. Didn't want to squat heavy... well
I did a bit (150x2 without a belt is GREAT). Heavy splitsquads, mid but really
slow legpresses, intense extension + curls. PLUS MIGUEL. 

It was Roman's birthday today!

### 2024-04-24 14:37

My laptop was at the beamline for the first time xDD Freaking funny!

Have my vacation request, luckily wednesday is a free day at CERN as well.

### 2024-04-26 02:09

Today we actually reasearch some shit! I HAVE ALMOST NO IDEA WHAT THO (K49 -
new stuff in hyperfine structure). But loved the excitement about it!

I'm doing what I can to keep my stuff running on whatever they throw at me...
and it shows. Just magically whipped out an UDP chat bot in like a minute to
actually listen to where does one PC decide to connect (no screen, keyboard or
mouse down in the hall with wifi as connection and fucking jumping around IP
addresses). I felt like GOD making it work in NO TIME!

Grafana now running from different pc and looks smooth! Let's see what another
day brings.

Last gym session before Spain. Good back. This girl is really staring me down.
Have to make a move xD FOR SCIENCE!

### 2024-04-27 00:04

HEYO! So it's friday, and tomorrow there is a big TRIP coming. I should be
sleeping already... Around 4:30 at CERN and then airport! No laptot, but might
try to take notes and transfer them later!

Slow work today as we didn't have beam for most of it (booster problems). I did
OCR on our webcam for apparently no reason as the cam is gonna move. It wasn't
working that well either. 

🦆❤️ talked for a moment (birthday party of one of the guys). That Z. really
wants some beef (always fucking glued on her...). I still believe in her good
and smart mind not to fall for that.

Good night and see you from Spain 🇪🇸 and Portugal 🇵🇹!!

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/228BxWXUYQPJrJYHDLOHkj?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

### 2024-05-02 09:06

*Monday* morning (or as we like to say... Thursday but after the beamtime).

Home from Spain/Portugal trip. Was great fun. Bit socially exhausting but fun!
Was really happy to see new places and visit new countries. Also, mature fun -
a vacation gym sessions xD

Will have to add some pics back here. These say a bit more than I can :D

Back to work now!

### 2024-05-03 01:26

Sleep now, write later ...

Calm calm day, not much work, not that many people at work. Bunch of guys are
taking their time off because of all their overtimes during beamtime.

Got a fucking noob answer from the IT support... "*Is that proprietary software
open source? We could test it... And is it up to date???*". So wtf.

Did some legs afterwards. Those were nice! Slow low 140 squats for 3x3. And a
long leg day like that.

### 2024-05-04 01:45

Friday, no gym today. Resting with 🦆❤️ and movies :)!

### 2024-05-04 22:20

Saturday, was for a small Gex hike. One and only day with a bit of fine weather
so one had to take that opportunity! Nice (cloudy) view on a forrest trip,
nothing harsh but felt good, the end was super nice!.

In the evening I went to the gym to see Miguel possibly for the last time. We
hit off it with a back/chest workout day! I guess I'm alone again.

### 2024-05-06 21:03

Sunday was about nothign xD did laundry, read a little, cleaned a little.
Watched movie and cleaned my shoes.

Monday on the other hand was quite exciting. For one I figured that I have to
buy the golf clubs myself... Because that's not moving anywhere! And at work
I'm tasked with an interesting challenge of changing the TDMS2matlab conversion
script to a CPP TDMS2root thing. Gotta work with Ilaria on that a little! 

Both Ila. and Am. were independantly asking me if I already know something
about a possible extension... We'll see, maybe I'm gonna be lucky or useful
enough that they (Mag.) want to keep me a little longer! *Just enjoy the most
you can out of whatever is left!*

Backday in the evening, Pendley rows with 100kg to try. GOOOD. But I gotta
shorten it a little because I'm generally taking really long nowadays... (1.5h
max!)...

### 2024-05-07 13:36

Was I really just helping Mag. with refactoring Marcu.' sentences in his thesis
POG xDD I should be a freaking co-author on that thing.

The sentence to remember: *the sequencer processes the parameter sets from the
queue to coordinate the external devices and the FPGA*.

### 2024-05-08 08:55

Full day of working and it was great! `TDMS2ROOT` coming well together! 

Gym afterwards which was great! Maybe because of those caffeine pills before xD
Had such a good pump (deserves a pic tho! TODO)! Finally started working out
earlier so was able to be home before 10pm and get some bed time as well!
Altough my asian friend kept me out a bit longer, I still got some rest and
feel great today!

### 2024-05-09 17:33

Free day today! So lazy, cinema in the evening and not much else xD.

Yesterday was great, working went fine, almost noone in the office. Got
response from NI that it would be probably for the best to wipe the system and
do full reinstall xD That makes everyone really happy xDD It's gonna be fun
next few weeks. Went to the lab and had more cpp fun.

Gym in the night! HUGE LEG DAY. Everything done till death! And it was amazing.
Also met Neeko in there. Met *allegedly* the Brazilian girl and then the bad
posture girl which stalks me a little xD Went for that and got IG from all xD
No problems xD Also hit a proper 160 squat alone! And then all the painful
things :D

Going for a cinema today. The Fall Guy, should be fun! Also bought my golf
clubs! LET'S GO!!! Can't wait. Should have gone for it much sooner! Live and
learn...

Bit homesick again... feel like I need to stay alone to get it out for some
reason... we'll see

### 2024-05-11 03:20

HELL a long night! 

Calm work day today. Talking sentences of Marc. thesis, only 4 of us in the
office xD only PhD. students + Amy. Doing bunch of cpp nowadays, again on
Pico5000 with Amy, working well tho! (although we went home around 6:30...) And
then trip to ISOLDE to help Il. with bringing PSU modules back to epool. Fun!

Then good evening workout! Back day with Niko and Brazilian around xD Got a few
compliments and a little flex with her! Like wtf so good! Plus some good
flexing in the end. Good progress there.

AAANd then aurora! Wouldn't ever think that I had an opportunity to see that
around here! Even mum saw it at home. I'm even lower but had completely clear
skies so I managed to get some amazing pics and videos of it! Bit of evening
call and sleep.

### 2024-05-12 22:12

Sunday, home from the gym, enjoying life and calling people. The weekend was
nice, pretty calm Saturday and then meeting with Eva on Sunday and some
exercise and stuff today! Also finished documents for the guiding so gonna try
to meet the *Conor* McGregor during the week!

Also, golf clubs should arrive maybe tomorrow! I'm so looking forward to that!

### 2024-05-13 10:59

I've presented my stance on the pc problems and described what has to be done.
Felt so good to be in charge of all of it, actually beeing 100% on that matter.
I've done the research, checked with supportS, described results and gonna
finally do step towards solving it. One problem is that there is around 18 TB
of stuff on the PC+raid which I haven't ever worked with... soo probably some
tutorials time and let's see what we can do about it (and backups for sure).

ALSOOOO, GOLF clubs have arrived!!!

### 2024-05-13 23:35

Monday done, gym done. Bit too tired but great! We talked about the golf clubs
and they look amazing and parents are gonna send them to me asap.

### 2024-05-15 00:24

I'm currently resting after dinner and gym, texting with a brazilian mama xDD
Fun!

Work has been fun. Did bunch of my own stuff. Plane tickets, guiding stuff,
helped on magnet + cpp and we had a our local group physics meeting, which I
understood almost none of (as expected - I must have missed nuclear magnetic
moments in my second year physics...).

Did a little armday today, exchanged few close calls with brazilian and met
Niko. And also, this guy from SGP picked me up going from the gym and brought
me here faster! Great guy xD The same one we've shaken our heads because of an
ass (what a memory) xD

### 2024-05-15 21:57

Rest day today! So writing early today. 

Work was a lot of fun today, magnet stabil working again! It was dependant on
the orientation of the cables... Freaking hell... It works consistently now
which seems to be promising. I was doing cpp there, other working on the
bellows everyone is talking about! It was a really productive blast of a day! 

A bit of icecream on the top :P

### 2024-05-16 23:40

Thursday! Weather forecast was not lying so we mostly stayed inside the office
and I continued working on that TDMS conversion. Finally talked with Marcus
about it so managed to make some sense of the data. More tomorrow, I feel like
I'm getting close to a working TTree architecture now (at least not getting
that many errors or unexpected behaviors xD).

Also I finished the guiding presentation with Patrick! So I'm officially able
to do guiding around ISOLDE. COOL. Now I just need to learn stuff about it xD

Did chest day immediately afterwards (took mcdonald's before and with jumper
and all the stuff I weighted in at around 84/85 xD holy bulk! *So normal weight
around 80/81*). Did chest, benches, 100x2 and then few sets of 100x1, then 90x7
which was great! Greagt inclines with 35 and more. BUT my shoulder is still
hurting, I have to have it in a good position. Possibly gonna have to do a rest
week for the top to make this go away. Don't want to play around with it that
much if it's gonna hurt. 

My golf clubs were in Germany today around noon! I'm really really really
looking forward to them <3

### 2024-05-17 23:15

Week done! Friday pretty empty office again. But went to work on the magnet for
most of the day, actually had improvements again which is great! Ended up
sitting it out with A. at the end and chatting about all of it. I would really
like to see more of what comes up in the holidays, but I would also like to
spend some time home during that time... we'll see!

My YoungLA shorts have arrived, I feel the sluttiest I have ever been in the
green shorts and off-whites are just amazing!!
Some fine fine leg day to test the green ones. Absolutely dying on sets of
+200kg leg presses for 10-12. But that what's it all about! And some extension
with like 50 per leg and some holds around 90. Great job. I feel stronger on
these!

Not much planned for the prolonged weekend as I want to rest my shoulder to be
good later.

### 2024-05-21 09:21

So it's actually Tuesday, back at work. My golf clubs are most likely arriving
today! We'll see what we doing according to the weather, I would love to try
them out xD

Weekend was lazy, but I got some HS in and did some terrain improvements! More
to come.

### 2024-05-21 23:22

Evening here. Back at home after bit underwhelming day. Clubs should have
arrived, didn't as the reception was closed and/or the address is wrong. I
might stay home tomorrow to wait for them. 

At work did some great improvements to the Pico5000. A. just mentioned that we
discussed the implementation and I was just able to say that I have already
done it (*talk during the meeting*), which was epic. And a bit more work on
that after that.

Today's gym I did back and I wanted to do some strength prep for deadlifts
(200kg). So I've tried rack pulls (rug pulls as I like to type them xD). I've
done 200kg for 6 for 2 sets and managed to move 220 fine, got stuck on 240.
Epic thing and my back is absolutly fine with that (with no belt). Great. It
was mainly experimental today. More new exercises to try and it was a good one!
Shoulder feeling better.

### 2024-05-22 13:37

I stayed at home in the morning and when the clubs were not arriving I went
back to work. Did some 275 stuff as always and now we have just called the
French GLS. For some reason they picked up as soon as I called, so luckily Mark
didn't have to wait at all! Seems like all is fine and they should arrive
tomorrow! We'll see, I'm probably gonna wait for them again!

### 2024-05-22 23:42

Day done, leg day done. Amazing slow slow 130x8,x6 + 120x8 squats. Amazing
things. Also the new off-white shorts! Great!

Work was also fun, Amy found a problem with my wiring test implementation xD "A
little dance" xD Well, we had some fun in 275 optimizing pico5000 and the
"Fastest fourier transform in the west xD".

### 2024-05-24 01:43

I have my clubs here!! TODO: PICS PICS. 

Spent the day at home to wait for them. Spoke to three different postmen and
spent like 2.5h outside for them but GOOD all good got them.

### 2024-05-25 12:16

Saturday and I'm in PRAGUE. Yesterday was quite nice. Basically finished
my *tdms2root* project and managed to find more improvements for pico5000.

Then went and with a small delay flew to CZ to meet 🦆❤️. Enjoying all of it!

AAAND really looking forward to playing golf xDD

### 2024-05-26 23:40

We are WORLD CHAMPIONS!!! I'm back at France. Spent the weekend with 🦆❤️. She
had her birthday today so gifts and meetings with parents(+ H. & K.) for lunch
in Prague. Went well!

The plane was delayed again! Like 35 mins off start, because of trafic. Still
managed to see the last third of the game and at least listen to the radio
broadcast of the second one :)!

### 2024-05-27 22:21

Monday done! I'm for the third time at home today xD I went out of the office a
bit sooner to try to get my bike fixed, still need to take it somewhere else
tho... I went home and even though it was raining I've tried going to the golf
club to get stuff sorted. They were closed already, but I met a guy who was
training there, spoke english to me and said that the language is not gonna be
a problem. And I met a woman from the org hut in there who was a bit surprised
I came there (by foot even). Spoke to me a little french/english. We managed to
get it together, they are opened till 8. And tomorrow it's for sure gonna be
good! So let's go tomorrow! Training comences!

I went gym after xD There was still a lot of time. Did chest after a while. I
found why and how I managed to hurt my shoulder a little. But after I found the
wrong position on the bench, I was able to do normal sets (really slow and
controlled ones) with no issues! Even did incline with 35 with really really
slow reps for 8. Which is GOOD.

At work the magnet program finally starts, and it talks. Not everything works
,hahah the programming pin on the PSU is broken in 'whatever' position xD
that's gonna be fun. But my program works the way it should. Now we are able to
prompt whatever we want. So good.

And I've started the talk about prolongation and immediately I'm on the fance
of what I actually want. Mum helped me a little but it's still difficult.

### 2024-05-28 21:32

Tuesday and the first day of golf practice! It was really cool! Great weather
all day, didn't go from work as soon as I wanted to but managed to get like
hour and a half of playing around on the range and greens. Not that much
english around but some! Spoke french to get my ball card done. Had some nice
shots with the 4H. Gonna train more!

My YoungLA polo shirts came and they are freaking gorgeous!

At work some progress with the PSU controller. It's horrible but most of the
dip switches seem to be inverted xD We'll see what we can do about it!
It seems to be working now, we just have to find it's limitations!

Fun physics meeting where everyone came out of it more confused than at the
start xD

An episode of OnePace with A. and sleep!

### 2024-05-29 22:13

Calm day, was struggling with a bit of headache after lunch. But managed well
enough. Talked with I. about tdms that I did. Worked with some of my projects
later and changed a bit about PSC program.

Did a small back/arm gym in the afternoon and talked to the brazilian
afterwards xD Helped my headache at least. Gotta do some more golf and maybe
try the heavy deadlift at the end of the week.

My extension is kinda finalised now. Need to get it to school for some
paperwork but other than that it should be good!

### 2024-05-30 23:24

Long day, did some programming on the PSU. Seems to communicate better now and
I now understand what we have to do with it for it to work as we want! Some
paperwork as well for the extension. Spent the rest of the day in 275 with A.
which was quite fun.

There are now poster for the powerlifting meet with Barbie pics xD FUN And if
I'm staying that I could probably try it! At least a way to get into that gym.

There was this relay race happening today during our lunch. CERN full of people
in costumes running around xD Looked interesting xD Some of the ISOLDE guys
took it hella seriously xD Came back like the best winners.

Went for a golf training afterwards! 7 Iron impressively reliant for me, 4H
still amazing. Driver horrible. Need to find some help on that one. Chipping...
only when I'm not trying xD

### 2024-06-01 01:10

LET'S THROW THE GUY WHO DESIGNED THIS REHOS POS UNDER A (some not specific) TRAIN!

### 2024-06-01 20:40

GOLF BABY!! First official round today! TODO: PICS. Did 2.5h practice in the
morning and played a round finally in the afternoon! Was properly scared before
going there! BUT I've found something at the range today, I've implemented the
lesson of holding the glove under right armpit and raising a little and I'm
really really consistent in getting into the correct possition basically
always! And trying like 3/4 swings I'm really getting there! And even hybrid
was goood! I've made a deal with myself that I'm not using driver and I'm happy
about it xD Only 2 lost balls.

**I shot 56 (or 54** if Anežka is correct with the high voltage ruling). And I've
played from the blue/yellow ties. So I've made it even a bit harder on myself.

I was really happy about how I played with 1 par under my belt on par 3 and
almost a par 4 par, ruined by sketch topped pitch.

### 2024-06-03 23:50

Monday, there's a new coleague at work, from Sweden I think (Amy's summer
student). I've spent most of the day preparing magnet stuff, because I was
kinda the main talking about with the magnet software xD. 

Did gym in the afternoon. Met the guy who deadlifted with me on Friday xD he
was immediately complaining about pack pain xD ME TOO BROTHER, ME TOO...
Did back and my back is well improved now. Dunno if I'm hitting legs or golf
tomorrow xD Problems :)

One Pace with A. and early sleep hopefully!

Also YT showing me bunch of nice classic songs! TAKE SOME :P!

### 2024-06-04 21:10

Tuesday and a calm work day. We didn't manage to go for the magnet today, Mich.
was always on some meetings. But I managed to find AND immediately fix some
problems in the app for PSU controller. Some weird double drawing for plots...
QT QT...

It was really nice weather the whole day so I went back to the golf course with
intentions to try more of the short game and approaches. That went quite well I
have to say! But the long game suffered for whatever reason, just wasn't
feeling it properly and again was sterring it right on the long ones and
topping long clubs xD Weird little changes. Gonna be better. I like the place
so much, it's just great in there!

Planned One Pace with A. We've talked for a few hours yesterday xD Love <3

### 2024-06-05 23:43

Back from gym after legs, my back still hurts from last Friday, but managed to
do pretty nice squats as always xD Did a few sets of 5s with 120/130kg jsut to
see what the weight does to the back and it was completely fine! Love this kind
of bodybuilding style and it shows NOW! 

McDonald's on the way back and talk with A. for a bit :) All feels alright.

Work has been stale now. All the meetings about magnet safety, I'm prepared for
the tests so hopefully we'll managed to do it in time before I need to leave...
still can't find any place.

### 2024-06-06 13:33

We are transfering data (full raid is only about 5TB at the end, it's gonna be
fine...).

Also I finally went into buying the Google Drive extension soooo pictures will
be coming here shortly!

### 2024-06-07 23:00

Great great great CERN public event about 'Still mysterious universe' with
bunch of amazing people (Nobel prize, Harvard physics chair, etc). Lovely pics
from it and then physics and location related music. COOL FOR SURE! TODO: PICS!

Also the indian girl was for sure watching me waaay to much on the way back xD
Gotta shave! that must have been it! xD

### 2024-06-08 01:49

BTW SHAVED xD

It's now Saturday (Friday night), Degu and Mari arrived and we have seen a part
of ISOLDE at least from the main meeting room and they still seemed to be very
interested which I'm happy for! We are going out to Geneva tomorrow and then
some more CERN on the day after!

Should sleep already, but I came late from the gym. Was still postponing
everything and now managed to start more data transfer on the daq pc.

The gym went quite well! Good chest day with hella pump. Training a bit
differently because of a small shoulder pinch. But it's alright! Doing more of
a bodybuilder style and I like them! Also have been talking to bunch of new
people around there because of Niko mainly, which is nice.

And I'm fairly stressed about the accomodation... but I probably shouldn't be
as much... If it works great! If not, well it was amazing so far so why not
close it like that! There's no reason to pay 2000 just to work here a month
more. BE GOOD MAN! EVERYTHINGS GONNA BE ALRIGHT!

ALSO, I've listened to a really unexpected music for my normal liking in the
gym today! J. Cole and more! Let's hear some of that!

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/68Dni7IE4VyPkTOH9mRWHr?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

### 2024-06-10 11:25

It's Monday now! Degu spent another night in Geneva because the airplane travel
conditions were horrible yesterday! All the flights were getting canceled. I'm
glad they arrived to see me tho. Really nice visit of CERN's first accelerator
SyncroCyclotron (or something like that). That's actually a thing I've been
walking around basically every day for the past 5 months without any knowledge
of it being there! COOL PRESENTATION Signal-Fest-like. And the visitors
center was great as well! I'm gonna spend so much on my last days picking
souvenirs from there. And I know what I can bring back to A. and the others
:P I think we all might have nice fun with that (or the things might be a bit
dumb or too complicated for fun... we'll see!).

ALSO I did a morning golf session on Sunday! Like 8 o'clock on Sunday. Didn't
play that great but had fun and met the stranger Josh who was really kind but
fast playing xD

Also I've been working on the backup through the weekend like a GOOD BOY!

BTW I've really moved the erosion sim to the next level and it's finally
getting into a great shape!

<img src="images/erosion_normals1.png" alt="ter2" width=40%>

### 2024-06-11 00:10

Monday done. I'm back after gym and ate and watch some Shōgun already. 

Did back day today and all was good. I still know about the back but nothing
hurts in a wrong way! Pretty great pump. Also went for Decathlon before and I
bought more new golf balls (necessary... xD).

Work alright! Finishing up the transfer of the data and prep for the reinstall.
And also preping for the magnet with software ready and reinstalling the 275 pc
for it.

### 2024-06-11 01:02

My mind is really scattered because of the extension rn...

### 2024-06-12 00:16

Done for the Tuesday. Finishing late as we were fooling around/calling with
with 🦆❤️  in the evening after I came from the gym.

Did chest today and started with the bench. I was worried but managed to do
100x2 in the end! It feels like the pain zone is getting smaller and smaller
with each week. So that's a great thing. Karol came and I'm literally the only
guy she greets in this way xD They must be jealous. At least they can
understand her xD It was a strong workout and I can do basically everything
again! 

At work there was basically only 4 of us xD I fixed some cpp (*ROOT*) for
Mateusz in the morning and after lunch I spent a bit of time with Louis
discussing some of his changes and fixing compilation issues on his new way of
the Pico project build proces. AND he's not a programmer at all! 

Guy should have been someone with MRI and computer science background. He
studies physics, did a little programming at school and went for a summer
job/internship to a place where there was someone working with MRI xD MAN
that's what CV bragging get's you...

### 2024-06-13 00:31

Heyo! We doing just fine. Had a evening talk with A. It's all good. Went to
range in the evening, to practice my driver. I was finally able to pull it a
bit more straight, but man it's hard. Gotta need some trainer to perfect it and
truly trust it more... altogether it was a nice session.

I've been all around at work. Helping Louis to understand some of the codes and
Anu asking me to proof read her *theoretical physics* python (plus Magda's and
Mark's paper on the topic) xD

<img src="images/gandalf_yes.png" alt="gandalf" width=40%>

But I've genuinely been able to at least understand a the idea behind it and it
allows me to check what's going on in there :D Luckily!

We are still waiting on some of the components for the diode box so that is
still ongoing process. I'm really waiting for that magnet power up :D

### 2024-06-13 17:39

Finishing the working day!

Man I have just made the sexiest (yet trivial) piece of advanced C++ that, *I
think*, I have ever written!

### 2024-06-14 21:12

OK so weird weird things. Ended week with a pretty calm day with a really small
amount of peolpe. We have talked about bunch of stuff mainly including M. She
disallowed Anu to get married xDDD She asked her in advance to let her know
that she wants to take longer time off around Christmas to get married and she
didn't approve it xD And a lot of fun about that...

Did golf today and it went really well! I managed to change my grip slightly
and I feel much better not turning over the wrist! It's going really straight
and well.


### 2024-06-15 11:32

Saturday and another round finished. I shot 50 on the SG 9! Two pars (on 3 and
4 pars !!!). My changes to the grip really helped. 

Also met Amy at the roundabout. She came to see Marius who has been hit by a
car on his way home on the scooter. They smashed the front windshield. Luckily
she texted me that he should be mostly OK!

### 2024-06-17 11:06

Just a recap from yesterday! Played another golf course - the [Jiva
Hills](https://www.jivahillgolf.com/). It has only artifical tees and greens. A
weird feeling for sure and I didn't have any tees which would be good for that
so I started everything off the ground! Which made it a bit harder for sure but
I still managed to score pretty well! I did the front nine, fairly frustrated.
Was turning again and shit. BUT I stuck with it and extended my stay to all 18
holes (9 hole course with 2 starting positions and 2 holes per green). The
second nine is obviously harder than the first one and I shot 11 over on the
second nine! THAT'S HUGE PB. I even shot my first birdie!!!! (par 3 138m - tee
to the fringe and putt from there to like 6/7 meters).

Also just finished my second ever chairman position on our Monday morning
meeting. Went fine although it was a bit long as Magda with Mark were gone last
week on a conference. So there was a lot to discuss.
 
A lot of work for me this week from what it looks like. We want to power up the
magnet this week and I'm still not sure which capabilities are we missing.

### 2024-06-18 01:00

An absolute bizzare moment on my way home in the bus! Today I wore my offwhite
youngla shorts. On my way back I sat down in the bus at CERN and infornt of me
was a pair (nerdy guy and kinda hot girl). Girl immediatelly watched me and
legs and everything but in a way that seemed like she's making fun of me. She
spoke to the guy and both were kinda laughing about something so I was like,
sure they are making fun of me. Continued to listen to music and didn't mind
them. Both kept watching me from time to time. The girl was kinda like
goth/emo/rave style (not my type at all). Down half the journey I saw her
picking some stuff up and recongnized something like a eu passport. Didn't
think much of it. Around the roundabout, I see her with a sharpie
doing/scribbling something. Second roundabout and I'm getting up for the door
which is like just next to them (they are behind my back). We stop, I get to
open the door and the girl reaches over, touches my shoulder and gives me a
FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER and tells/whispers me something in the voice of the weird
people (she spoke french I think xD). I GOT A PHONE NUMBER FROM A RANDOM GIRL
ON THE BUS (and she actually looked alright)! That's a new one xD 

ABOUT The rest of today! The work was great, I was the chair of the morning
meeting. Magda came with two new polish high school students and then Jiří from
Brno came to our office (summer student of Michael). The magnet power up is
close by and we still don't know all that's neccessary for it! It's gonna be fun.

And then I felt like the gym was shit (but it was mainly my bench which was
struggling) but tbh I don't remember when did I do bench the last time and also
I'm now doing fairly bit different bench press technique with a very slow
movements. I feel good about it and the pump is there! But the shoulder is
still complaining a little. I might try to go to some physio at home.

### 2024-06-18 23:23

I'm back from gym, kinda disgusted. I'm really really easilly getting this
lower back pump/pain. Was trying to do easy 150 deadlifts. Did 5 of them.
pretty easily! Went for second set, did 1 and immediately felt that the back is
out of power. So I stopped there, fucking horrible. Did some more back
exercises and that was completely fine. Just dunno what's up with the lower
back. Gonna have to do some improvements on that.

I'm probably taking a few days of now. It shouldn't hurt...

At work we had the recording crew at ISOLDE. Might have been BBC what what do
we know. We have done really nice live background. I managed to make Mich. talk
about the magnet when the crew was coming so it really looked like we did two
something! xD

[HMM lower back?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmGArQBtFI)

### 2024-06-19 21:29

Movie night with 🦆❤️! Taking some time off to let my body rest a little. There
could be something wrong, so I need to take some good food and rest and it's
probably gonna be fine! 

Fun time at work, bunch of time spent in ISOLDE in the afternoon. Actually I
left close to half past 7... Well that's what you get when you do test just a
day before the day-m (magnet xD). QT had some problems (for example running
timers in threads is not allowed... WHYYYYY). I still have one problem there
which I had no idea why it was happening! This voltage/current set which
freezes everything as if there was some deadlock or infinite loop. It's just
weird. Gotta change it a little tomorrow and it's gonna be fine!

### 2024-06-20 16:31

Spent the whole morning at ISOLDE hall alone. Did some magic on the magnet
program and it is working like a minimal viable product... Bunch of the
functionality is missing, but it is what it is. The QT just works differently
than one would expect.

Just finished preparing second version, which does not use threads at all so
I'm gonna go and test it against the old one... (probably tomorrow tho xD)

Also fun at the lunch, went alone because of my ISOLDE visit xD full canteen so
I set down close to some 3 english speaking girl. I finished my meal and girl
turn to me and just start to be extremely interested about everything about me.
12th year from London trip for a 3 day visit of CERN. Cool and they have been
really interested. Funny how they just chose to approach me out of nowhere, but
I don't mind.

### 2024-06-20 22:10

Those exercises that I found for the lower back (upper glute) really do be
targeting the area which I felt and they actually made it much better!

Also did some more exercises, pushups and etc.

### 2024-06-21 10:28

It's mum's birthday today! Work stalling my progress with magnets. 

### 2024-06-23 10:28

An. is here! Some fun/golf/shop today, some longer trip tomorrow. What a trip
for her to get here! xD

### 2024-06-24 23:01   

Chamonix trip today! We are dead xD 3842m above the sea level (or something
like that) - again... we are dead. We took the bus there... The car rental was
like 300CHF... Now eat and sleep. Gotta add some pics later: TODO: PICS.

### 2024-06-25 22:50

First golf together xD Ended with a literal storm! Went alright. It's really
really hard to explain and train someone in such a difficult movement without
proper training knowledge. But it went well and she seemed to like it decently
xD We tried to do a little on the range at the end but that's properly
difficult and my feel is really hard to explain... But it looked good!

### 2024-06-27 08:52

SOO 🦆❤️ is still here! The plane got delayed, then canceled again. Fun with air
travel, I really thought it's the best kind and now there has been so many
problems xD

But at least I had her here the correct amount of days :D Her visit has been
awesome. The main Chamonix trip was really worth it and adventurous. I think
that now I'm the proud owner of the height record in family with the heighest
telecabin in France (3842m).

Now fixing some place where to stay during July. Have something for most of it,
just missing like first 4 days or something like that, it's gonna be fine!

### 2024-06-27 22:49

Watching An. flying home. No gym today, I've spent a long time coming back for
her and then on the airport with her. I'm seriously not complaining :D Just
want to sleep a little and there wouldn't be time for that if I went to gym
then.

Still trying to figure out some place to stay. Going tomorrow to the reception
to see if anything has changed.

Watching Shogun. Now on the 9th episode. I thought there is only 8 of them so
I'm always getting surprised (pleasently) that there is always more to go xD

### 2024-06-29 02:37

Good day, good workout! Solid back day with no issues and nice pump and call
with An. :) Then a movie with her and late late sleep.

Had a nice idea for new evo project I wanted to try for a while. We'll see
where it goes. The repo is in the place xD

Also listening to a bunch of Rammstein at the moment xD

### 2024-06-29 10:41

PC works again! Another kernel panic (volume corrupted thingy) popped up. Dealt
with it the same way as before! Worked.

### 2024-06-30 00:35

Hello from hotel in SGP. I'm moved into this small small hotel room, but it's
gonna be alright for just a few nights. I successfully packed all my stuff,
fitted it although the main bag seems to be quite a bit heavier than it used to
be xD But all was good and moved it. 

Afternoon I went to get my bike back and to the gym and as it happened I
managed to get right on time with the concert in english church in Geneva that
Duncan invited me to. And I'm so glad that I've made it in there. Concert like
1:20, then went to see more of Geneva and after 8 dispatched myself towards gym
for a little chest day!

It was my 4th day in a row training I thing. Like 2 days appart from training
chest last time. SO when I did dumbells it hurt immediatelly xD I was doing
proper squeezy ones and I felt every rep with a great pump in the process! I
love it! Shoulder was complaining a little but I think it was just as tired as
the rest of the upper body! So it's alright!

### 2024-07-01 21:38

A bit of Linux nvidia work today on my own. Some GPIB test - psc config works
now! Improvements! Then some Lua/C++ learning time! Gonna continue with lua
tomorrow!

Staying at home today! We spoke with mum for a lot and then with An. for more
:) It's been great!

### 2024-07-03 09:05

What a night yesterday! Last evening summer students had an invitational party!
So I infiltrated it and mingled with guys (everyone student of my age, so I
can't really complain). Party was great, met just so many different guys. It
got a bit worse when the loud music started and the stiff dance moves were
taking out! xD But it always got better for a moment. Spent most of the time
with Jiří and our high school polish friend (whos name I forgot), and they also
had their time with one other german girl.

Everyone was interesting, everyone wanted to talk at least a little! Was great!

Back to work now xD

### 2024-07-03 23:28

Work was fun. I was needed for some reformating of a python code from Anu which
they use alongside her sims. But the code is mostly completely fine! Other than
that I did some more lua learning and began to try to start EvoScripts project.

One of the colleagues from other ISOLDE group came to complain to our office.
The older guy who's always active at the meetings. And he completely wasn't
feeling the situation when EP safety is blocking something from RP safety just
because they felt like it and for a really minor reason. Guy really described
all of this as a Kafka's world xD

I'm home after gym. Pretty good back arm day. Texting with An. She's partying
with the others. The classic group is there. Just kinda miss her and I can
imagine what part of the group is trying to hit on that, which I am enabling
because I'm gone. So we'll see how it works for us. There's always gonna be
someone looking into that.

### 2024-07-04 15:11

I've moved into a new place! Luckily I was able to check in earlier so I didn't
have to wait such a long time at the hotel or somewhere else.

Ilaria's talk now, then zoom with Anu for a moment and then want to fit in gym
and the evening presentation + maybe meeting some guys from the student party.

### 2024-07-05 11:01

Hmmm mediocre presentation today. The guys presenting were fine, the moderator
was horrible and so agressive! I had fun listening to the German guy which was
almost overly optimistic and possitive about the rise and new usage of AI
everywhere and just once glanced over the environmental impact and then quickly
went away from that. Met Betty and Fabiona for the presentation so at least had
some known faces around.

After the zoom yesterday I went immedieately to the gym for quick 1h pump
session for chest and shoulders and bit of arms. It looked good!

Now running around, fixing/reinstalling PC for Betty after Kristyna. We had to
call to change some PC info to even be able to reinstall it through CERN PXE. I
for a moment thought that I bricked the PC or that I would need to reinstall
ubuntu back to change it and then do it all again. But ALL good... computer
science magic student after all! 

### 2024-07-06 01:52

Friday! Went well! I was helping Anu with the presentation of her code to Magda
and some other on sight changes which were needed. Pretty interesting coding
exam tbh ("And now would you be able to do it in completely opposite way xD").

Started thinking about program architecture for the EvoScript program but it's
just in the begginings (feels like there's so much to think about that I cannot
push myself from the start).

Did quick gym after that xD It was completely free because of today's match of
Portugal vs France. Sooo many people driving to Geneva with Portugese flags,
shirts, colors, etc. Did a quick leq workout to see the second half of the
match on the projector in R1. Talked with Fabi as well. But what a boring
match. Fun to watch the people caring for it that much, but literally nothing
has happened. Shame. Penalties pretty underwhealming so yeah... football.
Talked with other and walked home. So yeah, pretty late xD.

### 2024-07-08 10:16

Monday! A lot has been done on the weekend (well sports mainly xD). Went
bouldering on Saturday and golf and gym on Sunday! Was really fun. Yesterday I
was just spotting everyone in the gym and Karol was really onto me xD I'm
probably failry visible in there so I get asked quite often for help. Also the
small ripped guy was staring me down (curling 22.5 in his face helped)!

Also watched the first Matrix with An. this weekend as she has never seen it
and wanted to at some point (and we didn't know what else to watch). I've
enjoyed it so much as I heven't seen much of it lately and I understand the
whole story so rewatching felt much better this time! More to come!

### 2024-07-08 23:55

Finished monday quite well with a nice chestday! Felt weird as 100kg bench was
hard, but still did 102.5kg with the same effort... then was able to do 8 and 6
reps on 37.5kg incline. So weird xD

### 2024-07-09 23:39

Early out today! We have tested the magnet today! That was eventful and I have
some pics from it as well! TODO: Flow problem, then it worked, everything
worked with my software as well. Safety guy was impressed. Magnet guru was
impressed. And of course there were immediate changes just as I started the
program xD Like first first request - "ok, so put 5A and 0.7V", like sure if
all that was wanted at first was 0/0.1/1.5/2V. And then it kinda blew xD Burst
disc opened becuase one of the valves was left closed xD What a stupid f thing
to do xD Burst Disc like 1000 CHF, so fun. But my entry to the project was
great and it worked so I can be happy that we got to test everything as it is!

We spent there the majority of the day so actually a late late lunch and I felt
like going home earlier so went like 20 mins early, shop and then golf :) It
was really nice and finally barebly not warm! 

All good! + Started watching The Bear!

### 2024-07-10 16:02

Talk about B11 from Daniel. A really nice discussion afterwards which I helped
to start with the classical question - why do we do this and who asked for it
xD But it was actually a relevant thing to ask in this context.

### 2024-07-11 00:39

Wednesday done, after workout and dinner. Met my new apartment mate today!
Sabrina from USA - Texas. Couldn't have tell. She seems alright and is here
only for a few days. WOrking at Alice doing shifts. Poor her! My schedule would
be fucked even more!

Did a proper leg day today! 150x3 squats? Sounds alright! Felt great as well!
